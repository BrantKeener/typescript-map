# TypeScript Maps

TypeScript Maps is a typescript-based project utilizing Google Maps and faker npm. This is based on the first project in [Stephen Grider's](https://github.com/StephenGrider) excellent Udemy course on TypeScript. This is a very simple project that makes an API call to Google Maps and places markers based on data randomly generated by faker.

## Getting Started

Getting a copy of TypeScript maps up and running locally is an incredibly simple process. Start by heading to https://github.com/BrantKeener/typescript-map and click on the Clone or download button. Once you have cloned the repository locally, you will need to enter into the index.html file and add your Google Maps API key where there is the {API_KEY} variable:

```
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key={API_KEY}"></script>
```

If you do not already have a Google Maps API Key, follow the instructions in Prerequisites to obtain a key.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project, you will want to download the following:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
3. [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker)
4. [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/)

### Installing

Once node and npm are installed, the remaining requirements can all be installed easily in the node.js environment using npm as follows:

```
> npm install -g typescript

> npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

Furthermore, perform an `npm install` in order to install the dependencies located in the package.json. This will install faker, as well as the type definition files for faker and Google Maps.
